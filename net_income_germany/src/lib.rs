//! Calculates the net income from a given yearly gross income regarding German social security and
//! income tax laws.
//!
//! It can handle the calculations of the social security taxes for employed and for self-employed
//! income and can also take tax splitting for married couples into account.
//!
//! The following taxes and social security fees are considered for the calculation of the net
//! income:
//! - health insurance (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung)
//! - nursing care insurance (Pflegeversicherung)
//! - unemployment insurance (Arbeitslosenversicherung)
//! - income tax (Einkommenssteuer)
//! - solidarity surcharge (SolidaritÃ¤tszuschlag)
//!
//! # Example
//! ```
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), &'static str> {
//! // set the necessary input data values
//! let tax_data = net_income_germany::TaxData {
//!     income: 80000, // the gross income of one year
//!     expenses: 5300, // the tax-deductible expenses of one year
//!     fixed_retirement: Some(800), // an optional fixed monthly retirement rate (otherwise percentage applies)
//!     self_employed: false, // whether social security taxes should be calculated for a self-employed person
//!     married: false, // whether tax splitting due to marriage should apply
//! };
//!
//! // create the default configuration for a specific year (2024 and 2025 are supported)
//! let config = net_income_germany::config::create(2025)?;
//!
//! // do the tax calculation based on the input data values
//! let tax_result = net_income_germany::calculate(&config, &tax_data)?;
//!
//! // access the results (in this example just the resulting net income)
//! println!("Net income: {}", tax_result.net_income);
//!
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Configuration Value Adaptions
//!
//! The configuration applies the additional fee to the nursing care insurance that is obligatory
//! for childless people over 23 years old. For the additional health insurance fee, it applies the
//! fee of Techniker Krankenkasse. In case that you want to change any of those to other values, you
//! can do it as follows:
//!
//! ```
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), &'static str> {
//! let mut config = net_income_germany::config::create(2025)?;
//! config.health_insurance.premium_additional = 0.0025; // change the additional health insurance fee [0,1]
//! config.health_insurance.premium_nursing_additional = 0.002; // change the additional nursing insurance fee [0,1]
//!
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
